\begin{verse}
  I sailed a ^{D}wild, wild sea / Climbed up a ^{Em}tall, tall mountain \\
  I met a ^{D}old, old man / Beneath a ^*{A}wee ping willow tree \\
  He said now ^{D}if you got some questions / Go and ^{Em}lay them at my feet \\
  But my ^{D}time here is brief / So you'll ^{A}have to pick just three
\end{verse}
\begin{chorus}
  And I said \\
  ^{D}What do you do with the pieces of a broken ^{Gmaj7}heart? \\
  And ^{Gmaj7}how can a man like me remain in the ^{D}light? \\
  And ^{D}if life is really as ^{D7}short as they say \\
  Then ^{G}why is the night so ^{Gm}long \\
  And then the ^{A}sun went down \\
  And he ^{A} sang for me this song
\end{chorus}
\begin{bridge}
  See I ^{D}once was a young fool like ^{Em}you \\
  A^{D}fraid to do the things \\
  That I ^{D}knew I had to do \\
  So I ^*{A}play ed an escapade just like you \\
  I ^*{Em}play ed an escapade just like ^{A}you
\end{bridge}
